# Inventories
Code to solve various models with inventory accumulation choices.

The file `pe inventory.ipynb` sovles the steady-state model in Alessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan (2010). Writing something this complicated in a jupyter notebook is clunky, but I wanted the markdown cells so I could take good notes. 

The same code, but arranged in text files like you would normally work, is in the files `akm.jl`, `vfuncs.jl`, `setup.jl`, and `wrapup.jl`.

When you find bugs, please let me know!
